# User Stories
1. As an application debugger, I need an API that tracks my application's various tasks by date, so I know when certain tasks were executed before others.
2. As a game developer, I want to order my application's tasks by level of importance, so I can efficiently allocate my computer's resources and optimize performance.
3. As a developer, I want to categorize tasks based on tags, so I can filter them by their types.

# Exceptions
## 1. Task Doesn't Exist
If the user attempts to access a task that doesn't exist, the API returns a "Task Not Found" error to the application and prompts the user to check the task ID or create a new task.
## 2. Task Duplication 
If the user's application tries to create a task that already exists, the API returns a "Task Already Exists" error and tells the user to instead create a new one.
## 3. Unauthorized Access
If an unauthorized user tries to create, modify, or delete a task, the API returns an "Unauthorized Access" error.
