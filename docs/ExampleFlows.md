# Example Flows
## 1. Project Manager Creating a Task
Alice is a new project manager for a retail website. Naturally, she wants to keep organized and decides she wants to start by creating three tasks. Initially she calls POST /user/create to create an account with the Task Manager API, setting her username to "Alice" and her password to "password123". After succesfully being stored in the system and receiving her unique ID (response from POST /user/create), she calls POST /crud/create and fills in the fields for her first task "Design and Prototype". After receiving an "OK" response, she successfully inserts her other tasks, "Documentation" and "Testing/Debugging", the same way.

## 2. Employee Sorting and Completing a Task
Bob, an employee of Alice, wants to view his tasks by order of due date to see which tasks he should work on first. He calls POST sort/due_date which returns a list of tasks ordered by the timestamp they are due. He sees a task due today with ID 5001 and finishes working on it. He then calls PATCH /crud/update/5001 and sets the status to "complete".

## 3. Store Owner Categorizing Tasks
Robert owns a computer repair shop and uses the task manager to categorize repairs by their tags. He has tags for "laptop" or "desktop", the operating system "windows", "mac", or "linux", as well as the type of repair "display", "battery", "malware", among others. He recieves an order from a customer with a Windows laptop that won't turn on and he creates a task for it using POST /crud/create which returns an ID of 341. After determining the issue is with the battery, he adds a tag to the task using POST tags/341/add with the request { "tags": ["battery"] }. Before making an order for a new battery, he views all tasks with the tag "battery" using GET sort/tags with the request { "tags": ["battery"] }.
