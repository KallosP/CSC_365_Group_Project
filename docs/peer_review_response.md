# Peer Review Responses
## Code Review Comments
### (Sophia Chang)
1. Removed unused files.
2. Not a priority at the moment, can add later if more time.
3. Removed potion shop code.
4. Moved V1, V2, and peer review to `/docs`.
5. Removed unused imports from `/api` python files.
6. Since the user can edit any field, `RETURNING *` must be used to capture all possible edits to a field.
7. Added clarifying comments where needed.
8. This feature is not finished.
9. Removed redundant engine creation.
10. Changed spec responses to match.
11. Changed return to `user_id` from `OK`
12. Creating an account also logs the user in; added clarifying comment in spec.
13. Updated `ExampleFlows.md`.
14. Works well enough for now, will consider for future.
