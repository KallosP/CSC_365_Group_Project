## Description
We're planning on implementing a general Task Manager API. The overall purpose is to facilitate the management of various different tasks a user enters into our database via our API. Storing these tasks (and the user's information) in our database, allows for the tracking of tasks that are specific to that user. Our API will act as a helper for task management, offering several tools/features to help simplify the modification/viewing of tasks.
